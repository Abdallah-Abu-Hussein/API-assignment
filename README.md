 # API Assignment

**City Explorer web application is an online system that helps users to collect information about the cities around the world. One of the most important functionality in the system that you need to enhance, as a free-lancer, is the explore function. The end user should be able to write the city name and click “explore” to get useful information that helps the user know how to pack for an upcoming trip, such as: weather, map, food, etc... You need to deliver a report explaining the APIs you will add to the system and the enhanced functionality. For that, you need to follow the following activities:**
